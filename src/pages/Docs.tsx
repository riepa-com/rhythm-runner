              <strong className="text-foreground">URBANSHADE OS</strong> is a web-based simulation of a 
              retro-futuristic operating system, lovingly ripped off— err, <em>inspired by</em> the game Pressure. 
              It's like playing pretend, but with more terminal commands, fewer real consequences, and significantly 
              more underwater-themed existential dread.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything here runs in your browser. Your "files" aren't real files (sorry, they can't help with your taxes). 
              Your "passwords" are stored in localStorage (please, <strong className="text-yellow-400">PLEASE</strong> don't use real passwords). 
              The containment units contain nothing but your imagination and maybe some JSON data. 
              And the crushing pressure of the deep ocean? That's just JavaScript trying to parse your code.

              <strong>TL;DR:</strong> It's a fun, interactive experience that lets you roleplay as an underwater 
              facility operator. Click things, explore, break stuff, fix stuff, and try not to trigger too many 
              simulated emergencies. The monsters aren't real, the stress is optional, but the entertainment is guaranteed! 🐙✨
