That night turned into months of development, and the project kept growing far beyond what I originally imagined.",
      "I have written the vast majority of the code, from the window management system to the authentication flow, from the admin panel to the cloud sync features. The containment game, the messaging system, the developer console - most of it came from late nights of coding and figuring things out as I went.",
      "About AI tools: yes, they have been part of the development process. I use them to help move faster, but the ideas, the direction, and the decisions are all mine. When something unusual gets added to Urbanshade, it is because I thought it would be interesting, not because a tool suggested it. The personality of this project comes from the people building it.",
      "I am genuinely proud of what this has become. It started as something that maybe no one would ever use, and now there are people actually exploring it and finding features I forgot I built. That is a good feeling."

                It started on <strong className="text-primary">January 27, 2025</strong>. The idea was simple: 
                what would it take to build a fully functional fake operating system? Not just a mockup with 
                static images, but something with working windows, real applications, and actual functionality.
              </p>
              <p>
                What began as a weekend experiment turned into months of development. Features kept getting added - 
                an authentication system, cloud sync, an admin panel, a developer console, even a full game 
                built inside the operating system. Each new addition made the project more interesting, and 
                there was no reason to stop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Friends joined in to help with testing and ideas. The codebase grew. The scope expanded. 
                Somewhere along the way, what started as a joke project became something we are genuinely 
                proud of. It may not have a practical purpose, but it is ours, and we built it together.
