## What is this in the first place?

Urbanshade OS is a browser-first operating system project focused on a playful, developer-friendly desktop environment with a strong emphasis on documentation, package distribution (UUR), and developer tooling.

### Highlights - Bigger features you should know about

- Online Accounts & Cloud Sync (Introduced in v2.6, improved in v2.7)
  - Full Supabase-backed online account system: sign up / sign in, profile (display name + avatar), and account management.
  - Automatic and manual sync of settings, desktop icons, installed apps, and system state.
  - Visual sync indicators in the taskbar and Start Menu; UUR submissions can sync to Supabase cloud storage.
  - Better feedback and status display for cloud operations.

- UUR Manager & Package Ecosystem (Introduced in V2.5)
  - UUR Manager app (desktop + terminal access) for discovering, submitting, installing, and running packages.
  - Built-in sample packages (Hello World, System Info) and a GitHub-based submission + review workflow for community contributions.
  - Redesigned UUR Manager UI (v2.7): sidebar navigation, category filters, richer package cards, search improvements, and a statistics dashboard.
  - Real-time submission status backed by cloud storage.

- DEF-DEV (Developer Mode) Overhaul (Base made in V2.1, made public in V2.3)
  - Comprehensive DEF-DEV documentation and a multi-tab terminal experience (Console, Actions, Storage, Terminal).
  - New DEF-DEV Terminal with command queue and remote execution support; action monitoring with persistence and consent flows.
  - First-boot DEF-DEV setup with explicit consent, alternative dev storage for development, and improved crash entry workflows.

- Bugcheck / Crash Handling
  - New BugcheckScreen with severity levels, readable explanations, stack trace capture, and automatic bugcheck logging to DEF-DEV.
  - Styled crash screens for testing and clearer separation from real OS bugchecks.

- Documentation System (v2.2+)
  - Full in-app documentation with multiple guide pages: Getting Started, Core Apps, Facility Apps, Terminal commands, Advanced Features, Shortcuts, Troubleshooting, and more.
  - Multi-version changelog viewer and improved navigation across docs.

- Recovery, BIOS, and Installer Improvements (v2.1)
  - Modernized BIOS/UEFI interface, recovery mode with consistent theming, reboot options (including BIOS and Recovery shortcuts), and a proper app installer.
  - File Reader gained editing features and better integration with "Open with" workflows.

- Foundation & Architecture (Since v2.0)
  - Complete rewrite to a modern stack: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, Vite build system, and a component-driven architecture for performance and maintainability.

--- Other notable improvements
- Admin tooling and command queue (maintenance, safe mode, logout, and package helpers).
- Diagnostics and system health monitoring pages.
- Visual and UX polish across windows, taskbar, start menu, and animations.
- Ongoing bug fixes and quality-of-life updates (username display in Start Menu, copyright year, consistent versioning).

This has been being built by me, and some help from my friends and lovable.dev, since January 27, 2025. This has been my largest project to date. It was private until around
september, when since then its been public for everyone to contribiute and use, which is right around when V2.0 dropped.

## Where to find the full changelog
The full changelog can be found in the site!
Thank you for checking out Urbanshade OS - A *"passion project"*! contributors and community involvement are welcome!


## How to setup localy:

1. Download this repo
2. Download node.js (needed instantly)
3. Install miniweb (Or if you have python, get a python script that can run localhost. This setup will run over how to setup with miniweb)
4. After installing node.js, go to repo folder, open cmd and do `npm install` (This gets all the dependencies)
5. After getting the dependencies, do `npm run build` If you dont see any red text, there should be a dist\ folder.
6. Goto dist\ and put all the contents into a folder `htdocs`
7. Put miniweb in the folder where `htdocs` is located
8. Run miniweb

It should be good to go now on `http://localhost:8080` or `localhost:8000`
(depends machine from machine, if one doesnt work try the other!
